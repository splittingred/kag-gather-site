1364895631|Kalikst|Hello peasants!|<p>{nl}	This is Kalikst here and I&rsquo;m happy to introduce to you official KAG Gather website made by ilaks. That&rsquo;s a really nice piece of work he has done here and I hope you will appreciate it as well as I do. And I&rsquo;m not talking only about the design part which surely is greatly done but also about that more useful part that includes direct webchat to KAG Gather channel and links to KAG Gather Rules &amp; Guide. We are also planning on implementing some server status, but it&#39;s heavily under construction and we got some other priorities over that, so that comes later. By the way, if you have any suggestions on how could we make this site more useful, don&rsquo;t hesitate to post about it in proper thread on our social page. We would love to hear your feedback on our work.</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	&nbsp;</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	By now I&rsquo;d like to encourage you to come more often here since it&rsquo;s officially launched and expect news about KAG Gather, its development (changelog) and upcoming KAG events we are going to support.</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	&nbsp;</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	Besides that, I&rsquo;m going to leak you that our lovely bot developer &ndash; splittingred &ndash; is now working on version 2.0 of KAG Gather bot that would take your gather game experience to the entirely new level! When? Soon! Very soon!</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	&nbsp;</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	I hope you enjoy your stay here. Stay tuned and see you on KAG Gather!</p>|||1|||use_html=1|
